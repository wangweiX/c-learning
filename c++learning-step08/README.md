# Step08 - while、for、do while Loops

### while
The while statement is the simplest of the four loops that C++ provides, and it has a definition very similar to that of an if statement:

``` c++
while (expression)
    statement;
```

### for

The for statement looks pretty simple in abstract:

``` c++
for (init-statement; condition-expression; end-expression)
   statement;
```

### do while
``` c++
do
    statement;
while (condition);
```
