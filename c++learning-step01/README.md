# Structure of a program

#### Statements

> Statements in C++ are often terminated by a semicolon.

```c++
int x; // declaration statement
x = 5; // assignment statement
std::cout << x; // output statement
```



#### Expressions

> An **expression** is a mathematical entity that evaluates to a value.

```c++
int x;
x = 2 + 3;
```



#### Functions

>A **function** is a collection of statements that executes sequentially. 
>
>Every C++ program must contain a special function called **main**. 



#### Libraries and the C++ Standard Library

> A **library** is a collection of precompiled code (e.g. functions) that has been “packaged up” for reuse in many different programs.
